# Digital-Filters-and-Estimation
Elementary investigation into some basic filtering and estimation techniques.

 - Notch and Butterworth filters,
 - And then some Kalman filter for optimal estimation,
 - And then some Extended Kalman filters for nonlinear stuff,
 - Maybe particle filters because they're cool; I wonder if one can make them faster.
