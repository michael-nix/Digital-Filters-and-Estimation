# Digital Filters and Estimation
Elementary investigation into some basic filtering and estimation techniques.

 - Notch and Butterworth filters,
 - Filters using Empirical Mode Decomposition & Intrinsic Mode Functions,
 - And then some Kalman filter for optimal estimation,
 - And then some Extended Kalman filters for nonlinear stuff,
 - Maybe unscented filters because they're cool; I wonder if one can make them faster,
 - Also, turns out particle filters aren't that hard, so that too.
